# Multi-class-image-classification-of-wildlife-images-using-deep-learning

In this paper we discuss multiclass image classification on a wild life dataset. The grading of the image is accomplished by distinguishing the image into the specified category based on content of the image. The images of various wildlife are used to train the model, so that it is used for classifying the images into different wild creatures. The deep learning technique like Convolution Neural Network is used to train the model and the model is used classify the input images. This research also used transfer learning technique where the data was trained with a pre-trained model called DenseNet. Library like Keras is used to apply deep learning techniques and the layers such as dense is used which connects input nodes to the output node and dropout layer in which the activation is set to zero. Finally, the model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss function. Applying optimizer tuning an accuracy of 92.40% was obtained on CNN trained model and 95.03% was obtained on pre-trained DenseNet model.
